# Capstone-Project
KPI Design, data relations, and business performance analysis 

ntroduction
You are a BI consultant tasked with a report for shareholder meeting to analyze financial statement KPIs that shareholders care the most, from top line sales to bottom line profit. Report flow includes 3 pages of basic analysis and 3 pages of in-depth analysis. Basic analysis includes 3 dimensions of a retail operating model - people, products and stores, and a 360-degree view of sales and profit KPIs. In-depth analysis includes 4-quadrant analysis, organic growth analysis and discount analysis. Design ideas come from Ready Player One (2018 sci-fi adventure film), cyberpunk games and pop culture. Backgrounds are created by multi layer overlay, blue-and-red neon glow and semi-transparent container to size and position visuals. Eyes and narratives follow the flow from KPI display (left) to primary analysis (middle) and secondary analysis (right). Number of visual groups on a page is limited to 6. Bookmarks and buttons are used to toggle multiple analyses in a limited space. A hamburger menu on every page to open and close filter. Details page at the end to configure a table with any dimensions and measures. Logo, brand and product icons improve presentation of report and give users look-and-feel to understand the business intuitively. One-minute demo gives users a quick start guide on how to user the dashboard.
